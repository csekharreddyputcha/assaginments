The goal of this exercise is to create a working program in Java to search relevant
documents / files for the given search term or phrase (single token), and return results
in order of relevance. Relevancy is defined as number of times the exact term or
phrase appears in the document.
We have attached 3 files for your program to read and use as sample search content. Your
project should allow the user to enter a search term or phrase at the command-line, execute
the search, and return results. For example:
Enter the search term: <user enters search term>
Search results:
<sample results start:
File2.txt – X matches
File1.txt - X matches
File3.txt – X matches
>
Enter the search term: <user enters search term>
For this project, create a modular “searcher” class to execute the search against the content.
You will have to create 3 iterations of this “searcher,” each with a different approach:
- Brute-force text searcher
- Text search using the regex API in Java
- Create an “index” of content using a data structure, like a hash map or binary tree.
- Write unit tests for each method
- Run a performance test that does 2M searches with random search terms, and
measures execution time. Which approach is fastest? Why?
- Provide some thoughts on what you would do on the software or hardware side to
make this program scale to handle massive content and/or very large request volume
(5000 requests/second or more).
